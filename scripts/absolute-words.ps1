<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Lists each line a commit range adds, in Markdown, in a comment or in a commit message, that
    holds an absolute word: <where>: <kind>: <words>: <the line>. It lists and does not fail.

.DESCRIPTION
    WHY (#219). The review rules say "Treat a quantifier as an instruction to enumerate", and
    the session that wrote the lines had not walked them: five of the eleven findings of PR
    #210's pre-PR review were one such word, and three of the eight of PR #216's (#213, counted
    2026-10-10). The list is for the session to walk before it spawns the reviewer
    (docs/agents/pre-pr-review-brief.md): does the sentence hold for each thing it covers.

    WHY IT DOES NOT FAIL. The words are in ordinary use. Of 92 listed lines read for #213, 30
    used one in passing. Exit 0 says the range was read, and nothing about what was listed.

    WHAT IT READS. The lines the range's diff adds, as they are at the end of the range. In a
    `.md` file, each of them. In any other file, the comment lines: one that opens with `#`,
    and one inside a PowerShell block comment. That covers the scripts, the workflow and the
    hooks. Then each line of each commit message in the range but the `Co-Authored-By` line.
    A word is matched whole and in any case: "overall" and "first-class" hold none.

    WHAT IT LEAVES. Code. On the two pull requests counted it added 15 and 6 lines, most of them
    a result string or a parameter named `All`, and one faulted wording, a self-test case's name.

    WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. Whether a line makes a claim. A claim with none of the words in $WORDS. A
    phrase broken over two lines. A comment after code on its line, the rest of a block comment
    that opens there, and a comment in a file that marks them another way, such as Lua's. A
    line of code that opens with `#` inside a string that runs over lines is read as a comment.
    A line that was moved and not changed is listed as added. A file git calls binary.

.PARAMETER Range
    The commit range, with both ends: -Range origin/main...HEAD. The diff is read as given,
    and the commit messages are those of the same two ends with two dots.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Prove a word is found whole and as a phrase, which lines are comment, and over a range in a
    repository it builds: which lines are listed and which are not, and what it exits with. That
    part needs git.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File scripts/absolute-words.ps1 -Range origin/main...HEAD
